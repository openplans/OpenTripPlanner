# Project Governance

OpenTripPlanner is a member project of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/members/current/). Development of OpenTripPlanner is managed by a Project Leadership Committee (PLC) which makes decisions by simple majority vote. The current members of this committee are (in alphabetical order):

|Name | Affiliation |
|-----|-------------|
| Sean Barbeau      | University of South Florida |
| Torbj√∏rn Barslett | Ruter Oslo |
| Sheldon Brown     | Cambridge Systematics |
| Andrew Byrd       | Conveyal |
| Drew Dara-Abrams  | Interline |
| David Emory       | Conveyal |
| Jasper Hartong    | PlannerStack Foundation |
| Tuukka Hastrup    | Helsingin Seudun Liikenne |
| Frank Purcell     | TriMet |
| David Turner      | ex-OpenPlans |

The PLC holds a quarterly video conference on the first Thursday of June, September, December, and March. An agenda is prepared as a collaborative document in advance of each quarterly meeting. These meetings are held at 9AM US Pacific time to accommodate members in the US Pacific, US Eastern, and Central European time zones.

We take care to avoid a governance system that is too conceptual or process-heavy. The main goal is to have regular agenda-driven meetings that yield clear decisions and action items assigned to specific people. The committee should ideally be composed of active, professional contributors to the OpenTripPlanner project, including representatives of organizations that host official public deployments of OTP.
