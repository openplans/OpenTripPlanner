/**
 * This the goal direction heuristic used for transit searches.
 *
 * Euclidean heuristics are terrible for transit routing because the maximum transit speed is quite high, especially
 * relative to the walk speed. Transit can require going away from the destination in Euclidean space to approach it
 * according to the travel time metric. This heuristic is designed to be good for transit.
 *
 * After many experiments storing travel time metrics in tables or embedding them in low-dimensional Euclidean space I
 * eventually came to the conclusion that the most efficient structure for representing the metric was already right
 * in front of us: a graph.
 *
 * This heuristic searches backward from the target vertex over the street and transit network, removing any
 * time-dependent component of the network (e.g. by evaluating all boarding wait times as zero). This produces an
 * admissible heuristic (i.e. it always underestimates path weight) making it valid independent of the clock time.
 * This is important because you don't know precisely what time you will arrive at the destination until you get there.
 *
 * Because we often make use of the first path we find in the main search, this heuristic must be both admissible and
 * consistent (monotonic). If the heuristic is non-monotonic, nodes can be re-discovered and paths are not necessarily
 * discovered in order of increasing weight. When finding paths one by one and banning trips or routes,
 * suboptimal paths may be found and reported before or instead of optimal ones.
 *
 * This heuristic was previously not consistent for the reasons discussed in ticket #2153. It was possible for the
 * "zero zone" around the origin to overlap the egress zone around the destination, leading to decreases in the
 * heuristic across an edge that were greater in magnitude than the weight of that edge. This has been solved by
 * creating two separate distance maps, one pre-transit and one post-transit.
 *
 * Note that the backward search does not happen in a separate thread. It is interleaved with the main search in a
 * ratio of N:1 iterations.
 *
 * This heuristic effectively makes traversal of non-transit vertices far away from the origin and
 * destination impossible by returning an estimated weight of Inifinity for vertices not within
 * walking or driving distance of the origin or destination.  The heuristic is initialized before
 * the main graph search and attempts to discover all non-transit verticies up to a certain limit.
 * Transit vertices are also explored, but only during the main graph search in the
 * {@link InterleavedBidirectionalHeuristic#doSomeWork} method.  During the main graph search, this
 * heuristic estimates remaining weights of vertices by returning the lower bound weights at
 * vertices found during the heuristic initialization and doSomeWork method.
 *
 * The limits encountered are currently either the {@link RoutingRequest#maxWalkDistance} or the
 * {@link RoutingRequest#maxPreTransitTime}.  The maxWalkDistance currently applies to both walking
 * and bicycling.  When traversing the network in a car, the maxWalkDistance is not incremented.
 * To mask off excessive travel by car, the maxPreTransitTime is used as a limiter.  However for
 * driving a car after using transit (for example with either a TNC, car rental or ride and kiss)
 * a limitation is added in {@link InterleavedBidirectionalHeuristic#streetSearch} to stop searching
 * through the graph once the origin has been found.
 *
 * In order for this heuristic to return the proper estimated weights during the main graph search,
 * it must be sensitive to the current mode of the current state in the main graph search.  For
 * example, in Park and Ride searches, the initialization of the heuristic will have explored many
 * more vertices while driving compared to the number of vertices explored by walking from the
 * origin/destination.  Therefore in the
 * {@link InterleavedBidirectionalHeuristic#estimateRemainingWeight} method, a mode-specific weight
 * is returned when a non-transit vertex is being evaluated.
 *
 * Shown below are a few visualizations of what the heuristic will do in various searches.
 *
 * Key:
 * O = origin vertex
 * D = destination vertex
 * W = reachable by walking up to maxWalkDistance
 * C = reachable by car up to the maxPreTransitTime
 * B = reachable by car or walking
 * - = vertices unreachable by either mode
 *
 * In a simple TRANSIT,WALK search, only the vertices within walking distance are marked as
 * reachable by the heuristic.
 *
 * ----------------
 * ----WWW-----WWW-
 * ----WOW-----WDW-
 * ----WWW-----WWW-
 * ----------------
 *
 * In a TRANSIT,WALK,CAR (park and ride) search, there will be vertices reachable by both walking
 * and driving, some only by walking and some only reachable by driving.  The park and ride search
 * does not allow driving after transit, so the vertices around the destination are only reachable
 * by walking.
 *
 * ----CCC---------
 * ---CBBBC----WWW-
 * ---CBOWCC---WDW-
 * ---CBWWCC---WWW-
 * ----CCCC--------
 *
 * In a TRANSIT,WALK,CAR_HAIL (transit + TNC) search, there are many more vertices explored while
 * searching from the destination in this current implementation.  The preTransitVertices may still
 * look about the same as the above graphic, but the postTransitVertices could look as follows:
 *
 * --------CCCCCCC-
 * ------CCCCCCBBBC
 * -----OCCCC--WDBC
 * ------CCCCC-BWBC
 * -------CCCCCCCCC
 *
 * This heuristic is espeically useful for large graphs, but could be turned off entirely for small
 * graphs.
