 * Filter or decorate itineraries. A filter can modify the elements in the list, but not the List.
 * It should treat the list as immutable. Do not change the list passed into the filter, instead
 * make a copy, change it and return the copy. It is allowed to return the list unchanged.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended that a filter do only one thing! For example do not change the itineraries and
 * delete elements in the same filter. Instead create two filters and insert them after each other
 * in the filter chain. This allows decoration of each filter and make it easier to reuse logic. The
 * {@link org.opentripplanner.routing.algorithm.filterchain.filters.MaxLimitFilter} work with both a
 * normal filter chain and the {@link org.opentripplanner.routing.algorithm.filterchain.filters.DebugFilterChain},
 * and the logic can be reused in several places. So, because of this, most filters can ignore the
 * debug-mode.
